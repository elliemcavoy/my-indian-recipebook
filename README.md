<h2 id="ux"><u>UX</u></h2>
This web based application's primary purpose is to allow the sharing of recipes. The recipes will be available to browse by any visitor to the website. However, additional functionality will be made available for user's that register on the site. A search functionality will provide any visitors the ability to search for recipes by a keyword such as an ingredient or name. Registering on the site will allow users to, once logged in, edit and delete their own recipes. It will also allow them to add other user's recipes to their favourite's list which will then be stored in their profile and be readily available for them to view. A leaderboard on the main page will also allow visitors to see the current most voted for recipes.
